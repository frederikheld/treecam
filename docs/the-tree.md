# The Tree

In spring I eagerly await the burst of the first buds which will soon cover the whole tree in fresh green.

In summer it provides shade during the afternoon with a great sundown after the sun shows up on it's right hand side again. It also and hums from all the bees and insects that live from it's juces.

In autumn it is my scale to see how the days get shorter every day until the sun doesn't show up on it's right hand side anymore but sets behind it. Leaves are falling and create a mess on the street below it.

In winter it is just there. Empty and naked, sometimes covered in snow. Waiting for the spring that makes it juices flow again.
